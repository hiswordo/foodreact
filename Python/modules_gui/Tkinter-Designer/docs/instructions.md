# Getting Started <small>[[Top](#table-of-contents)]</small>

<a id="getting-started-1"></a>
## 1. Install Python
Before using Tkinter Designer, you'll need to install Python.  
* [Here is a link to the Python downloads page.](https://www.python.org/downloads)  
* [Here is a helpful guide to installing Python on various operating systems.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

*Later in this guide, you will use the Package Installer for Python (pip), which may require you to add Python to your system PATH.*

## 2. Install Tkinter Designer
Once you have Python installed, you can download Tkinter Designer from the [official repository](https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer).

On the right-hand sidebar, click the latest release and, under **Assets**, choose `tkinter_designer.exe`. After the executable has downloaded, you are ready to run the program!

*To run Tkinter Designer from the source code, follow the instructions below.*

1. Download the source files for Tkinter Designer

2. Unzip the source files to a directory on your system
   
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in this directory
   * You can navigate to this folder using the `cd` command.
   * You can also use an IDE with a built-in terminal, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * In the event that pip doesn't work, also try the following commands:
     * `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
     * `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
     * `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
   * If this still doesn't work, ensure that Python is added to the PATH.
  
5. You can run Tkinter Designer by running `python tkinter_designer.py`

## 3. Make a Figma Account
1. In a web browser, navigate to [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) and click 'Sign up'
2. Enter your information, then verify your email
3. Create a new Figma Design file
4. Get started making your GUI
   * The next section covers required formatting for Tkinter Designer input.
     * [Here is the official Figma tutorial series for beginners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2dkpBxst8&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4)
     * [Here is the official Figma YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/c/Figmadesign/featured)

# Formatting Your Figma Design <small>[[Top](#table-of-contents)]</small>

<a id="formatting-1"></a>
## 1. Reference
<br>

### Naming is Important

| Figma Element Name | Tkinter Element |
| --- | --- |
| Button | Button |
| Rectangle | Rectangle |
| TextArea | Text Area |
| TextBox | Entry |
| Password | Password Entry
| Background | Canvas.Image() |

<br>

The code generated by Tkinter Designer is based on the names of elements from your Figma design and, as such, you need to name your elements accordingly. In Figma, rename your elements by double-clicking them in the Layers panel.

<br>

## 2. Element Guide
<br>

1. **First, create a Frame that will serve as your Tkinter Window.**
   * To Create a Frame press <kbd>F</kbd>.
   * You can either select a size from right side or make your own.
<br><br>

2. **Creating a Background Or Images**
   * Backgrounds & Images can be created using shapes and/or images
   * Any layer named "Background" would be added as Canvas Image to the generated code.
<br><br>

3. **Text (Normal Text)**
   * Use the <kbd>T</kbd> key to activate the text tool, then add text as desired
   * Text does not have to be renamed for use in Tkinter Designer
   * Explicitly press the <kbd>Return</kbd>  Or  <kbd>Enter</kbd> Key to move to the next line.
<br><br>

4. **Entry (Single-Line User Input)**
   * Activate the Rectangle tool with <kbd>R</kbd>
   * Adjust the Rectangle to your liking
   * Make sure the Rectangle is named "TextBox"
<br><br>

5. **Text Area (Multi-Line User Input)**
   * Activate the Rectangle tool with <kbd>R</kbd>
   * Adjust the Rectangle to your liking
   * Make sure the Rectangle is named "TextArea"

6. **Rectangle**
   * Activate the Rectangle tool with <kbd>R</kbd>
   * Adjust the Rectangle to your liking
   * Make sure the Rectangle is named "Rectangle"
<br><br>

7. **Button**
   * Add a shape for the button.
     * Optional: Add text for the button.
   * You can also use image for a button.
   * Select the button shape, and any optional text, then group them with <kbd>CTRL/&#8984; + G</kbd>
   * The group should look like this now. It will work fine !

   * But if  you have multiple shapes or images for the button then group all the shape layers together. And leave the text layer at the top.

   * Name the group "Button" Or Use Plugin

<br>

### **Naming is Important !**
Every element is converted to code on basis of their names. 

If a element has unkown name then it would be converted to a black rectangle. But if the name has mismatched then Tkinter Designer is likely to crash.

# Using Plugin to skip Naming part

You can use [Figma-Low-Code](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/858477504263032980/Figma-Low-Code) Plugin to skip the naming the elements.

Watch this video to know how to use the plugin.

## 3. Test Your Generated Code
1. In Tkinter Designer, click the **Output Path** form to open a file browser
2. Choose an output path and click **Select Folder**
3. Press **Generate**

The output files from Tkinter Designer will be placed in your chosen directory, inside a new folder called **generated_code**. Congratulations, you have now created your Tkinter GUI using Tkinter Designer!

# Troubleshooting <small>[[Top](#table-of-contents)]</small>

* Elements not visible? Misplaced?
  * Please make sure that your top-level Frame is positioned with its X and Y coordinates at (0, 0)
    * Check the right side bar, under **Design**

* Button has an unintended gray background?
  * Make sure you have added a Rectangle behind your button element, and that its Fill color is the same as the Background's

* Incorrect elements?
  * Make sure you have named your elements correctly in Figma
    * See [Formatting Your Figma Design, &sect;1](#formatting-1)

* Window is larger than the screen?
  * Reduce the size of your elements in Figma

* Files not generating?
  * Restart Tkinter Designer
  * Double-check the token and URL
  * Make sure your design has a Frame

* Something else?
