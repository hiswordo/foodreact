This will be the final boarding call for flight to London, Heathrow.
I'm not even gonna say it, Kate.
Then it'll be like I never left.
Wait.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
About the plane? You think it's gonna crash? Don't say that.
No. Look, I know that we've talked about this a thousand times
and we agreed that going to London was the right thing to do.
But in my heart...this feels wrong.
Don't go, Jack.
You mean don't go at all?
Well, what...what about my internship?
Believe me, I know...I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you.
